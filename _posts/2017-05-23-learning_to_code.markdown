How did I end up here? A student at flatironschool learning full stack development. It seems strange to me really. I've worked in a few different fields over the last 15 years, emergency medicine as an EMT IV Tech., auctioneer for the automotive industry, and ski lift mechanic at the local ski resort where I live. 

The one thing all those very different jobs have in common for me is that I was never passionate about them. They all were just something that I did to pay my bills and earn a living. That lack of excitement about what I was doing for a living is how I ended up coding.

# Journey begins

I started coding as a hobby almost 5 years ago. I was traveling around as an auctioneer selling new car dealerships. At night after work, I would sit in my hotel room and watch tutorials on sites like, Teamtreehouse.com and codecademy.com. It was my hobby. It helped me relax and de-stress from the day. I found it exciting and when I would learn something new, and at that time is was mainly HTML and CSS, I would build something right away or improve a personal project I was working on. 

Coding was my preferred form of entertainment, but I never considered it would be something I would make a career or living from. Fast forward a few years... I found my interest in code growing, and I would be distracted throughout my day thinking about something I was working on or had learned about the night before, this and my increasing dissatisfaction with work is what started my journey to flatironschool.

# Front End Techdegree

It had become apparent to me that I needed to pursue coding in a more serious way and move away from just being a 'hobbyist'. That path wasn't clear to me though, and I was apprehensive to look at a 'bootcamp', the price tag and time commitment was intimadating. I had the opportunity to take a 7-month course with teamtreehouse in their new Techdegree Program. I enrolled in the Front End Techdegree Program in July 2016. This was a test for me personally. I felt that if I could complete this program which consisted of 12 projects and a couple 100hrs of curriculum then I would be ready to look at a 'bootcamp'. The first week of April 2017, I graduated!

I worked 6 days a week and 12hour work days on third shift during the program, which I wouldn't recommend doing by the way, but still I managed to complete the program and build 12 projects which I'm proud of and can be viewed on my portfolio website[ nicholasdamico.net](http://nicholasdamico.net).

# Flatiron School

A few days after finishing at Teamtreehouse.com, I was driving home listening to an episode of 'CodeNewbie' podcast and heard Flatironschool mentioned. That evening I went home and checked out the site. It appeared to be a great school and the bootcamp prep was free, so there wasn't anything to lose, I signed up right away and started the curriculum. I looked at a few other schools and tried out a few other bootcamp preps but Flatiron's felt 'right', and I was learning a ton. I had talked with a couple of great men and women on their staff and applied in March and was accepted. Sunday was my 2nd week at school and I couldn't be happier, I'm so very thankful to have this opportunity and excited for whats to come... I've finally found something I'm passionate and excited about.

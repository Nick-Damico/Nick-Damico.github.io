<p>I'm a web development student from Gatlinburg, Tenn. who has been coding for the past 4 years as a hobby. In 2016 I decided that I wanted to change my life and do something for a living that I'm passionate about and love, so I enrolled and finished a Techdegree @ TeamTreehouse in March 2017. Wanting to further my skills I decided to attend The Flatiron School. Prior to this I've worked as an Auctioneer, EMT-IV Tech, Snowmaker and ski lift mechanic.</p>
